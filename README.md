The ActiveMQ Artemis broker container images have release tags and special tags.

The image release tags point to images built from the sources of the releated release tags,
i.e. the `1.0.0` image release tag points to the image built from
the sources of the [v1.0.0](https://github.com/artemiscloud/activemq-artemis-broker-init-image/tree/v1.0.0) release tag

The image special tags are `latest` and `dev-latest`.
The `latest` tag points to the image built from the sources of the latest release tag.
The `dev-latest` tag points to the image built from the sources of the main branch, it should be used only for development purposes, it expires 7 days after the push.
